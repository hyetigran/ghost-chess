### Invisible Chess - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

Invisible Chess is a mobile application that offers a unique twist on traditional chess. Players can only see their own pieces, while their opponent's pieces remain invisible. This creates a game of memory, deduction, and strategy that challenges even experienced chess players in new ways.

- Standard chess rules apply for piece movement, check, checkmate, etc.
- Each player can only see their own pieces on the board
- Opponent's pieces are invisible until captured
- When a player attempts to move to a square occupied by an invisible opponent piece, the move is rejected
- When a player captures an opponent's piece, it becomes visible briefly before being removed
- The game tracks and displays captured pieces for both players
